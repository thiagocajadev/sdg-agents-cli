# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added

### Fixed

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Smart Auto-Bump — integrated `CHANGELOG.md` promotion into the automated versioning pipeline; the `post-commit` hook now automatically moves entries from `## [Unreleased]` to the new version header.

### Fixed

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Pedagogical Writing Soul — refined `writing-soul.md` instruction set with inviting, prose-centric guidance; eliminated em dashes and negation-affirmation patterns in favor of direct engineering wisdom.
- Internal Governance Sync — automated the synchronization of project assets to the local `.ai/` directory via CLI `init` protocol.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Governance terminology synchronization in Portuguese and English documentation.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Automated Bump & Changelog Governance — integrated a standard semantic versioning strategy into the SDG ecosystem; added `scripts/bump.mjs` template and unconditional Husky `pre-push` integration for JS/TS projects.
- Interactive Bump Opt-out — added Step 8 to the `sdg init` wizard to allow users to toggle automated versioning.
- CLI `--no-bump` flag — support for bypassing automation in CI/CD or specialized environments.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Internal Terminal Resilience — hardened Husky hooks with a Path Discovery block to ensure `node`/`npm` availability in non-interactive agent shells; codified abstract "Toolchain Discoverability" principle in global engineering standards; added generic "Terminal Sanity Check" to agent session start protocol.
- Version-Aware CHANGELOG — hardened `Phase: END` instructions to include finding the next package version (patch/minor) instead of defaulting to generic `[Unreleased]` headers.
- npm publish `bin` validation — removed invalid relative `./` prefix from `package.json` bin path that was causing npm to remove the CLI executable.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- AI Backlog Knowledge Triad — separated project state from technical expertise by introducing dedicated `.ai-backlog/learned.md` (success patterns and research) and `.ai-backlog/troubleshoot.md` (RCA and failure logs); implemented Selective Lazy Loading to inject knowledge into the agent's context only when relevant (`feat:` for learned, `fix:` for troubleshoot)
- `end:` intent prefix — universal cycle terminator that forces sequential execution of the END Phase checklist (SUMMARIZE → CHANGELOG → BACKLOG → CURATE → LINT → COMMIT → PUSH); adapts CHANGELOG category by active cycle type; accepts no argument
- `land:` intent prefix — inception cycle that turns a raw vision into a grounded backlog of sequenced `feat:` tasks before any code is written
- Multi-agent execution protocol — Planning (SPEC/PLAN/Review) and Fast (CODE/TEST) roles for Claude Code; auto-enabled when `ide: claude` or `ide: all`; graceful single-agent fallback for all other environments
- Scope rule for multi-agent handoff in `agent-roles.md` — `[S]` tasks run single-agent; `[M]`/`[L]` tasks always spawn Fast after PLAN approval

### Changed

- Governance consolidation — eliminated structural redundancies to reduce cold-context overhead per session: removed duplicate Session Start block, Governance Oath, and bootstrap template from `AGENTS.md`; converted verbose XML `<context_routing>` to markdown tables; removed redundant Phase: END sections from command files; trimmed multi-agent TIP blocks from all command files (now a single reference to `agent-roles.md`)
- Context Load in Phase: CODE is now domain-scoped — loads `backend.md`/`frontend.md` only when the task domain requires it, rather than always loading all competency files
- Bootstrap process now reads `CHANGELOG.md` in addition to `package.json`, `README.md`, and entry points

### Fixed

- `post-commit` hook path corrected from monorepo layout (`packages/cli/src/engine/bin/auto-bump.mjs`) to standalone repo path (`src/engine/bin/auto-bump.mjs`) — version bump was silently failing after every commit
- `auto-bump.mjs` `ROOT_DIR` traversal fixed (5 levels → 3) and `PACKAGE_PATHS` pruned to single root `package.json`; removed dead workspace-detection logic in `resolveRootPackagePath`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Interactive CLI (`sdg init`) to scaffold AI governance context into any project
- Governance instruction assembler — generates `.ai/skill/AGENTS.md` at runtime
- Asset bundle system — packages governance templates into a distributable bundle
- Support for backend, frontend, and fullstack competency profiles
- TypeScript and JavaScript idiom layers
- Multi-language support (EN/PT-BR) for governance assets
- Working Protocol: SPEC → PLAN → CODE → TEST → END lifecycle
- Feature, Fix, and Docs cycle commands (`sdg-feat.md`, `sdg-fix.md`, `sdg-docs.md`)
- Session backlog system (`.ai-backlog/context.md` + `tasks.md`) for cross-session continuity
- CLAUDE.md governance integration for Claude Code
